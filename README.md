# zk-forge
A forge where zero-knowledge proofs are crafted at scale.

A decentralized marketplace that seamlessly connects requesters with incentivized provers for scalable, cost-effective computation of diverse zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs.


## Concept Overview:

We are developing a decentralized marketplace focused on scalable zero-knowledge (ZK) proof generation services. The platform connects requesters with provers who provide hardware-accelerated ZK proof computations (FPGA or GPU). This open marketplace enables permissionless participation and optimizes for price-performance efficiency, empowering use cases from zkRollups and ZK bridges to ZK-based machine learning (ZKML) and more.

## Key Components

### Prover Network 
Hardware contributors (provers) can offer computing power via GPUs or FPGAs to handle ZK proof generation. They can also integrate proprietary software to further optimize their computational performance
    
## Requesters: 
Users can submit tasks for ZK proof generation, including zkRollups, ZK bridges, zkCoprocessors, and ZKML, among other use cases. These jobs are priced based on complexity, required proof type, and performance needs
    
### Matchmaker System
A decentralized matchmaker evaluates both buy (demand) and sell (supply) orders in real-time. It pairs requesters with the best available prover based on factors such as type of proof, price, and performance. The system ensures optimal matching between cost and performance for both parties.

Additionally, a matchmaker should work in conjunction with a **reputation system**, where provers with more contributions and better performance ratings receive higher prioritization for matching. 

### Incentive Model:
Provers are incentivized to offer competitive price-performance ratios. Higher demand is funneled towards provers that deliver faster, more cost-effective solutions. Upon successful computation, the prover receives the payment pre-funded by the requester.

### Permissionless and Scalable:
The network allows anyone to contribute hardware as provers in a permissionless manner. It scales seamlessly with new participants, ensuring that the marketplace remains decentralized and competitive.

### Pre-funded, Trustless System:
All jobs are pre-funded by the requesters to ensure trustless interactions. Fees are automatically transferred to provers once a valid proof is successfully generated and verified.


The system is to be in favour of many industries: blockchain scalability (zkRollups), cross-chain solutions (ZK bridges), privacy-enhancing technologies, and even AI with ZK-powered machine learning. By enabling open participation, we can create a broad, decentralized ecosystem with incentives driving innovation and efficiency in zero-knowledge proof computations.
